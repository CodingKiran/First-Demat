## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
While working with the top brokers section, it was fun because, to make it responsvie to different breakpoints - I had to adjust the html, update the css to match it with how I imagined.  

## Lessons Learned:

Experimented with css to see what difference it can make for this project and noted the same.

## Examples:
